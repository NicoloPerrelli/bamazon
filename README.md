After the start of the program it will imidiatly throw up the index of items names, quantites, etc.
Next it then ask the user what id of what item they wish to buy.
If they give a non valid awnser it will say so. (this includes any item with 0 in stock)
next it asks the user the amount of the item they wish to purchase.
once again checking awnsers to see if there is even enough in stock to sell to user.
lastly some math is done and variables are updated to finaly post the index again.
